Add this "command" to your 
C:\Users\&username%\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\shortcuts.xml
(Obviously, don't add the outer tags; that's just to show you where the command goes)
The first command will add "Compile Squiffy Story" to your RUN menu.
It will build just the story.js file in the .sq files' directory without the index.html, style.css files.
If your squiffy file is named "Bob.sq", then the new js file will be called "Bobstory.js".  If you don't want the "story" part in the name, just edit the commandline below.
The second command will add "Build Squiffy Story" and create the squiffy story normally with it's index.html and story.js and style.css just like the Squiffy Editor.
