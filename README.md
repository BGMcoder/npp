Customization files for Notepad++

## Installation

### To install a User Defined Language (syntax highlighter) in Notepad++ 7+

Place the xml file in your Notepad++'s settings directory, which is usually this:
C:\Users\brgabriel.RCH\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs

### To install the syntax highlighter in Notepad++ older versions

In the main menu, go to View > User defined language...
Push the "Import..." button.
Browse to the syntax colouring file.  It may be either an .xml or a .udl file.
It will report "Import Successful"
Now, go and open one of the configuration files in Notepad++.
Voila!  Colour!

### RUN Commands

## The Goodies

### Squiffy

There is a User-Defined Language, and a couple RUN commands (to build it from the RUN menu).

### Aserisk

There are two kinds of UDLs for Asterisk.
- Asterisk.xml  - for .conf files
- AsteriskSys.xml - for .sys files
- and there is one for Polycom Config files - for .cfg files
Since other kinds of files are .conf, .sys and .cfg, you might skip the setting the file association for the UDLs if you use those other highlighters.
